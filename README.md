# AI Detector using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to evolve potential solutions for an AI-related task, such as optimization or classification. It provides a step-by-step simulation of natural selection—where candidate solutions improve over time according to a defined fitness function.

Built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook, the project is ideal for education, experimentation, and demonstrations of evolutionary computing concepts.

## How It Works

The Genetic Algorithm implemented in this project follows the classic evolutionary cycle:

1. **Initialize Population** – Generate random candidate solutions (chromosomes).
2. **Evaluate Fitness** – Use a fitness function to score each individual.
3. **Selection** – Select parents based on fitness scores.
4. **Crossover** – Combine parent genes to form new offspring.
5. **Mutation** – Apply random mutations to introduce variability.
6. **Next Generation** – Repeat the cycle until a stopping condition is met.
